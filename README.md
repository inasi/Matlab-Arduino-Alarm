# Matlab-Arduino-Project
This project is coded in Matlab and uses Arduino hardware 
It is a night terror alarm that detects sound and motion as input from sensors connected to a Grove Board. When a night terror is detected, an LED light is switched on and a tune rings to wake up the person, and a live graph showing spikes in voltage from motion is produced.
